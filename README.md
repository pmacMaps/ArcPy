# ArcPy
This repository contains sample Python scripts developed for Esri's ArcGIS Desktop using the ArcPy site package, and Python 2.7.  

If you are looking for sample scripts written for ArcGIS Pro (Python 3), please visit my [Esri-Arcpy-Python repository](https://github.com/pmacMaps/esri-arcpy-python).

I also have a [repository of sample scripts](https://github.com/pmacMaps/ago-admin-scripts) for administering ArcGIS Online (Python 3).
